# Cogwyrm MQTT Tasker Plugin - Project TODO

## Current Status
The project is a Tasker plugin for MQTT communication, allowing automation of MQTT messages through Tasker. We have made significant progress in refactoring the code to align with best practices from the Tasker Plugin Sample project.

### Components Overview
- `MainActivity`: Basic MQTT client UI
- `MQTTService`: Android Service for MQTT operations (✓ Enhanced with proper lifecycle management)
- `MQTTClient`: MQTT client wrapper (✓ Enhanced with connection stability)
- `MQTTActionReceiver`: Tasker action plugin for publishing messages
- `MQTTEventReceiver`: Tasker event plugin for MQTT message triggers (✓ Enhanced with robust subscription management)
- `MQTTConfigActivity`: Tasker configuration UI for publishing
- `MQTTEventConfigActivity`: Tasker configuration UI for triggers (✓ Refactored to use base class)

## Remaining Work

### 1. Refactor MQTTConfigActivity
- [ ] Update MQTTConfigActivity to extend TaskerPluginConfigActivity base class
- [ ] Implement MQTTActionHelper for Tasker-specific setup and validation
