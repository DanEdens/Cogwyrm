# Relationship between MQTTEventInput and MQTTEventOutput

1. MQTTEventInput is used to configure the MQTT connection details like broker URL, port, SSL usage, credentials, client ID, topic to subscribe to, and QoS. It implements the TaskerPluginInput interface and uses annotations to define the input fields. It also has validation logic.
2. MQTTEventOutput represents the data received from an MQTT message, including the message payload, topic, and timestamp. It uses the TaskerOutputObject annotation and defines output variables.
3. MQTTEventConfigActivity uses MQTTEventInput to populate its input fields and allows the user to configure the connection. It assigns the user input to a MQTTEventInput object.
4. MQTTEventRunner uses MQTTEventInput to establish the MQTT connection and subscribe to the specified topic. When a message is received, it creates a MQTTEventOutput object with the message data.
5. MQTTEventHelper ties it all together by defining the input, output and runner classes for the Tasker plugin.
6. So in summary, MQTTEventInput provides the configuration, which is used by MQTTEventRunner to actually make the MQTT connection and subscription. The received messages are then packaged into MQTTEventOutput objects to be passed back to Tasker.
7. The test classes provide additional details on the expected behavior and edge cases.
I think this gives a pretty comprehensive picture of how the two classes relate and fit into the overall architecture. Let me know if you need any other details!

Based on the code search results, here is a summary of the relationship between the MQTTEventInput and MQTTEventOutput classes:
MQTTEventInput is used to configure the MQTT connection details that the plugin will use. It includes fields like:
Broker URL and port
SSL usage
Username and password for authentication
Client ID
Topic to subscribe to
QoS (Quality of Service) level
It implements the TaskerPluginInput interface from the Tasker Plugin Library, and uses annotations like @TaskerInputField to define the configuration fields. It also includes some validation logic to check things like non-empty broker URL and valid QoS values.
MQTTEventOutput represents the data that is received when the plugin gets an MQTT message. The key fields are:
The message payload
The topic the message was received on
A timestamp of when the message arrived
It's annotated with @TaskerOutputObject and the fields are marked with @TaskerOutputVariable to integrate with Tasker's plugin system.
The two classes are tied together by the MQTTEventRunner. When a Tasker event is triggered, it uses the connection details from MQTTEventInput to establish an MQTT connection and subscribe to the specified topic.
Then when an MQTT message is received, the MQTTEventRunner takes that message data and packages it into an MQTTEventOutput object. This output then gets passed back to Tasker to be used in the task.
The MQTTEventConfigActivity class provides the UI for the user to actually input the configuration details. It populates its input fields using a MQTTEventInput object, and when the user saves, it bundles up the entered values back into a MQTTEventInput to return to the plugin.
Finally, the MQTTEventHelper class defines the input, output and runner classes to use for the plugin, connecting all the pieces together.
The unit tests verify the expected behavior, like making sure the MQTT connection is properly established with the configured details, messages can be received and parsed, and various error cases are handled correctly.
So in summary:
MQTTEventInput = configuration for MQTT connection
MQTTEventOutput = structured representation of received MQTT message
MQTTEventRunner uses MQTTEventInput to make MQTT connection, and emits MQTTEventOutput when messages arrive
MQTTEventConfigActivity provides UI for inputting MQTTEventInput
MQTTEventHelper wires everything together into a Tasker plugin
